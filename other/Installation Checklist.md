## Setup checklist

This is a checklist to confirm that your laptop is set up properly for DCS 210. If at any point you get an error message, please note the error message and we will help you to fix it! 
If you don't get any error messages, you are properly set up.

Please post a message in the "setupchecklist" channel in Slack once you have walked through the entire checklist. That way, we will know whether or not we need to follow up with you.


### Installation and Setup
* Install the [Anaconda distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Python 3.7x. This is a good installation guide [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-windows) 
you should read first for the basics. The videos below are OS specific and very much woth watching!
	* For Windos, go [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgjEUcccRwM); he has a blog post [here](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-python-on-windows-anaconda-c63c7c3d1444) as well.
	__NOTE__: Be sure to set you path in the command prompt
	* For Mac, go [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk)
* Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* Once you receive an email invitation from [Slack](https://slack.com/), join our team and add your photo (if you like)!

### Python
* Open an Anaconda prompt window (or on Mac you can use Terminal):
    * Type `conda list` (if you choose not to use Anaconda, this will generate an error)
    * Type `python` to open the Python interpreter (the prompt should look like >>>)
* While in the Python interpreter:
    * Look at the Python version number. It should start with 3.7.
    * Type `import pandas`
    * Type `exit()` to exit the interpreter. You can now close the command line application.
